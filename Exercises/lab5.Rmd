```

In this lab you will write a first draft of the `fwd_stepwise()`
function as a modification of your `recpart_fwd()` algorithm
from lab 4.
As noted in the week 5 exercises, the key modifications are

* Replace the indicator functions H() with mirror-image hinge functions.
* Do not remove parent basis function $B_m(x)$ after it
is split. We are therefore adding two basis functions in 
each outer-loop iteration.
* Only split basis function $B_m(x)$ into $B_m(x)h(t-x_v)$
and $B_m(x)h(x_v-t)$ for variables $x_v$ not already involved in $B_m$.

Save your `fwd_stepwise()` function and any supporting functions in
the source file `mars.R` in your group's Project folder on GitHub.
Create another file `mars_testing.R` that contains the following code:

```
source("mars.R")
set.seed(123); n <- 10
x <- data.frame(x1=rnorm(n),x2=rnorm(n))
y <- rnorm(n)
rp <- fwd_stepwise(y,x,Mmax=2)
```

Commit all of your changes to GitHub.

The numbered points below offer some suggestions on how you might
implement the three modifications.

1. Rather than initialize B to have Mmax+1 columns 
and `splits` to have Mmax rows,
initialize `B` to a one-column matrix of ones and `splits` to
a list with a single element:
`splits <- list(data.frame(m=0,v=0,s=NA,t=NA))`.
As the algorithm adds basis functions, use `cbind()` to grow `B`
and `c()` to grow `splits`. (Note: if you have a list ll and want
to add a new list item that contains data frame dd, use c(ll,list(dd)).)
2. Replace the for loop over values of M from 1 to Mmax
with a while loop that loops until M$>$Mmax (this is a bit trickier than
it sounds). To what value should
you initialize M? By how much do you
increment M at the end of each iteration of the while loop (see 4 below)?
3. Only split basis function $B_m(x)$ into $B_m(x)h(+(x_v-t))$
and $B_m(x)h(-(x_v-t))$ for variables $x_v$ not already involved in $B_m$.
You will need to consult the $m$th element of your `split` list to see which 
basis functions make up $B_m$.
4. Do not remove parent basis function $B_m(x)$ after it
is split. We are therefore adding **two** basis functions in 
each outer-loop iteration.
5. Replace the indicator functions $H(+(x_v - t))$ and $H(-(x_v-t))$ with hinge functions. 
6. While looping over basis functions, variables and split points,
keep track of `lof_best` **and** 
the best m, v and t as well. When you finish the three loops, 
construct left- and right-split data frames from splits[[m]]
and add these to the splits list.
7. Have `fwd_stepwise()` return the final set of basis functions 
for the data and the `split` matrix that can be used to 
reconstruct the basis functions for any input `x`.
